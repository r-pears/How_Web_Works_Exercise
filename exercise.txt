PART 1

What is HTTP?
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, it handles how clients send data to, and receive data from a server.

What is a URL?
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, an URL is an address specific for an internet resource.

What is DNS?
DNS stands for Domain Name System, this is a system that converts the URLs to IP addresses.

What is a query string?
The query string is a key-value pair that you can use to send in special parameters to the URL you're requesting.

List two HTTP Verbs and their use cases.
GET - receive data from the server, without sideeffects.
POST - send data to the server, with sideeffects.

What is an HTTP request?
An HTTP request is a request from client-side to server-side, following the HTTP protocol.

What is an HTTP response?
An HTTP response is a response from the server-side to client-side, following the HTTP protocol.

What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
Headers are used to pass along additional parameters in a request or a response.
Request headers are for example: Host, Cookie, Accept.
Response headers are for example: Content-Type, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control.

What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
First the browser converts the URL into an IP address using DNS.
Then the browser makes a request to that IP address, the request includes headers which pass along additional parameters.
The server will handle the request, and send back a response - a body which is normally HTML, a status code, and additional information.
The browser takes the response and creates the DOM from the body, and will get any additional resources which could be needed, such as images, and JavaScript.
Lastly, the browser makes individual HTTP request for each of those additional resources and receives the response from their respectively servers.
